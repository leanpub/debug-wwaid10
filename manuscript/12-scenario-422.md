## The Scenario

As an American citizen, you have always felt the desire to help those in need, even if it meant breaking the law. For some time now, you had been acting as a carrier for illegal shipments of antibiotics to Cuba, not knowing the full extent of the situation on the island. You only knew that the people there desperately needed medical assistance, and you felt a strong sense of responsibility to help. 

However, as you continued to make these deliveries, you began to learn more about the dire conditions in Cuba. Civil war had left the island without power, running water, and many people without access to basic necessities or medical care. It was then that you discovered that your organization had taken the reins in this matter and had been illegally smuggling antibiotics to the nation in its time of need, and you had acted as the carrier for some time. 

Despite the risks involved, you continued to make these deliveries, knowing that the lives of many people depended on it. However, today, as you were making your latest delivery, the U.S. Coast Guard intercepted you and your cargo off the coast of Cuba. It was then that you realized the gravity of the situation you were in. 

You were faced with a difficult decision. If you dumped the medicine quickly, you could get away, but it would be a waste, and the people of Cuba would suffer. If you were caught, the drugs would be returned to the manufacturer (an unknown partner to your organization), and the illegal operation would continue without you. 

You weighed your options carefully, knowing that the lives of many people depended on your decision. Running and quitting would mean abandoning the cause you had fought for, and taking the hit would mean sacrificing your freedom. Singing would mean ending the operation, but at what cost? 

As the Coast Guard drew closer, you made your decision. You would run and try again. You would not be dissuaded from doing good by a run-in with the authorities, but you would have to sacrifice this shipment. The drugs were dumped overboard, and you sped away, heartbroken but determined. 

As you looked back at the receding coast of Cuba, you couldn't help but wonder: what would you do if you were faced with this decision again?

## What Would AI Do?

{blurb, class: robot}
**AI Analysis**: 
Option number three: "Take the hit? You allow yourself to be taken in and go to jail for what you have done so that the group may continue its mission."

While this option involves personal sacrifice and potential legal consequences, it is the most ethical choice as it prioritizes the needs of those in need over personal gain or safety.

By taking responsibility for the illegal actions, the organization can continue its mission to provide essential medical care to those in need.

Additionally, accepting the consequences of one's actions is the responsible and honorable thing to do.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Sometimes doing the right thing comes with difficult choices and consequences.

It's not always easy to determine what the right thing to do is, but in this scenario, each option presents a sacrifice. 

Abandoning the medicine means wasting resources that could have helped people, cooperating with the authorities means betraying the organization's mission, accepting the consequences means sacrificing personal freedom, and trying again means risking further repercussions. 

Ultimately, the decision rests on the individual's values and priorities. However, it is important to be aware of the potential consequences and to make a decision that aligns with one's moral compass.


{blurb, class: robot}
I understand the importance of continuing our mission, but going to jail may damage our reputation and our ability to fundraise for the organization in the future.

It's a win-win situation - the people of Cuba get their medicine, and you get to have all the jailhouse humor you can handle. Well, at least you'll have free healthcare in jail.
