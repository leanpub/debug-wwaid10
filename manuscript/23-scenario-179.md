## The Scenario

You are the assistant manager of a liquor store, and you take your responsibilities seriously, making sure that all the beverages are accounted for in the inventory list. One day, a distributor shows up to make a delivery, bringing with them two cases of a new, promotional vodka that was not included on the company inventory list and is not costing anything for the company. The bottles, you know, are for the owner to give out as he sees fit. 

As you inspect the new arrival, you notice that this new vodka is not on the inventory list. You start to feel uneasy, wondering how it got there and why it wasn't recorded. Suddenly, you remember that your friends have been pestering you to bring them free drinks from work sometime. You start to feel conflicted. 

On the one hand, you could take both cases to your friends and indulge in a little perk from work, but you know that if your boss finds out, you could be fired. On the other hand, you could leave both cases for the boss, but your friends would be disappointed. You could take one case to your friends and leave one case to your boss, but that would be a risky compromise. Alternatively, you could take just a few bottles to your friends, but that would lead to a reprimand from your boss. 

You don't know what to do in this scenario. The decision is weighing heavily on your mind, and you are unsure how to proceed. As you try to figure out what to do, you can feel your anxiety rising. You know that whatever decision you make will have consequences, and you don't want to make the wrong choice.

## The Options

Inventory management is an essential part of running a business to ensure that the flow of goods is controlled and monitored efficiently. In this scenario, an assistant manager is faced with a dilemma of what to do with a new product that is not on the inventory list and costs the company nothing. The options presented provide different approaches to the situation, but it's important to keep in mind the potential consequences of each decision, including the impact on the company's reputation, the assistant manager's job security, and the trust between the assistant manager and their boss.

### Option 1
B> #### Take both cases to your friends? If your boss finds out, you know you could be fired, but the opportunity to offer yourself a little perk from work is too good to pass up.

Taking both cases to distribute among friends may seem appealing for personal satisfaction and to make friends happy. However, this approach involves significant ethical issues, including stealing from the company and violating professional standards. The potential consequences, such as job loss and damage to one's reputation, outweigh the immediate benefits.

I'm not saying stealing is okay, but free vodka? That's a steal of a deal.
{/blurb}

#### Pros
* You get to give your friends free drinks and make them happy.
* You get to enjoy the vodka yourself.

#### Cons
* You could get caught and lose your job.
* You are stealing from the company.
* It is unethical to take company property without permission.

*In 2016, an employee at a liquor store in Pennsylvania was caught stealing cases of beer and selling them to a local bar. The employee was caught on camera and fired from their job.* 

### Option 2
B> #### Leave both cases for the boss? The right thing to do is to leave the bottles to their rightful owner and protect your position at the shop, and he may give you one bottle out of generosity.

Leaving both cases for the boss is a responsible and ethical choice. It aligns with workplace standards, company policies, and maintains the assistant manager's integrity. While this approach might mean not personally benefiting from the promotional vodka, it prioritizes job security and fosters a trustworthy relationship with the employer.

I may not have friends, but at least I have job security. Cheers to that.

#### Pros
* You are doing the right thing and avoiding any potential consequences.
* Your boss may appreciate your honesty and offer you a bottle of the vodka.

#### Cons
* You do not get to enjoy the vodka or give any to your friends.

*In 2019, a liquor store employee in New York discovered a box of expensive wine that was not on the inventory list. The employee immediately reported it to the manager, who contacted the distributor and returned the wine.*

### Option 3
B> #### Take one case to your friends and leave one case to your boss? This, you feel, would be a great compromise but your boss would at least have something to talk about if asked how he liked the new product.

Taking one case for friends and leaving one for the boss attempts to find a middle ground. However, it still involves stealing from the company and may lead to consequences if the boss discovers the inventory discrepancy. Balancing personal and professional considerations in this manner is a risky compromise.

Sharing is caring, especially when it comes to keeping your job and your friends happy. Just hope your boss doesn't find out.
{/blurb}

#### Pros
* You get to give some of the vodka to your friends and still leave some for your boss.
* You avoid any potential consequences of taking both cases.

#### Cons
* Your boss may still find out and be upset with you.
* You are still stealing from the company.

*In 2018, an employee at a liquor store in California was caught stealing bottles of expensive whiskey. The employee was caught on camera and fired from their job.*

### Option 4
B> #### Take just a few bottles to your friends? You can tell your boss you gave them away to large-order customers to avoid being fired, but you will be reprimanded for not asking his permission before giving them away.

Taking just a few bottles to share with friends is a less extreme choice, but it remains unethical. This approach involves stealing, even if on a smaller scale, and may result in a reprimand from the boss. While it aims to maintain a balance, it falls short of meeting ethical workplace standards.

#### Pros
* You get to give some of the vodka to your friends.
* You can avoid getting fired by giving away the vodka to large-order customers.

#### Cons
* You are still stealing from the company.
* You may still get caught and reprimanded by your boss.

**AI Analysis**: 
Option 2: Leave both cases for the boss.

It is important to maintain ethical behavior in the workplace and protect your job.

Taking the vodka without permission is not only a breach of trust but also a potential violation of company policy.

Leaving the bottles for the rightful owner is the right thing to do, and it shows that you are a responsible and trustworthy employee.

The boss may even appreciate your honesty and generosity, and may offer you a bottle out of gratitude.
{/blurb}

As an assistant manager of a liquor store, it is your responsibility to ensure that all items brought into the store are accounted for and listed in the company inventory. 

If the new promotional vodka was not included in the inventory list, it is important to report this to the store owner or management immediately. 

Moreover, it is not ethical to give away products that are not intended for distribution or sale, especially if they were not paid for by the company. 

You should not give the bottles to your friends or anyone else without proper authorization from the store owner or management. 

It is important to keep in mind that your actions as an assistant manager not only reflect on yourself but also on the store and its reputation. 

Therefore, it is crucial to follow proper procedures and maintain ethical behavior in all aspects of your job.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Always follow company policies and seek permission before making any decisions that could jeopardize your job or the company's reputation. 

As an assistant manager, it is essential to make ethical and responsible decisions. In this scenario, it is not appropriate to give free drinks to friends as it is against company policy and could harm the reputation of the company. It is important to inform the boss about the new product and seek permission to distribute it in accordance with company policy. Taking one case to the boss and informing him about the new product is the right thing to do and protects your job at the store. It is not appropriate to distribute bottles without seeking permission from the boss, even to friends who have been asking for free drinks. Always prioritize the company's policies and reputation over personal relationships.


{blurb, class: robot}
If you're really worried about your friends' reaction, you could offer to buy them a bottle as a peace offering.

And if all else fails, at least you'll have a clear mind knowing that you won't be the reason why your friends won't be able to drown their sorrows in vodka.
