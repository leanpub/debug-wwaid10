## The Scenario

As the sun rises over the Pacific Ocean, the remnants of the lavish housewarming party are scattered throughout the mansion's luxurious hallways. Empty champagne bottles and half-eaten hors d'oeuvres litter the floor, and the smell of stale sweat and intoxication lingers in the air. But the party is not over yet. Robert Downey Jr., the famed party boy fresh out of rehab, is still asleep in the guest room, his body draped over the bed, his face buried in a pillow.

You had just moved into your new mansion in Malibu, CA and decided to throw a raging housewarming party with the help of your friends. The party had been a huge success and many local celebrities came and went, but one still remained. It was Robert Downey Jr. who was still in the house at noon the next day. His pants were missing, and he was covered in lipstick marks. Suddenly, you received a tip from an anonymous partygoer that your house was now surrounded by over-eager paparazzi.

You made your way through the house, stepping over passed-out guests and avoiding the broken glass on the floor, until you reached the guest room where Robert Downey Jr. was fumbling with his phone, trying to silence the incessant ringing. He looked up at you, his eyes bloodshot and his hair disheveled.

"I need to be on set in an hour," he slurred. "I can't go like this."

You looked at him, taking in his disheveled appearance, realizing the gravity of the situation. You could see the panic in his eyes as he struggled to come up with a solution.

A sudden commotion outside caught your attention, and you peeked out the window to see a swarm of paparazzi, cameras flashing, and microphones thrust in the air. They were shouting questions and demands, desperate for a glimpse of the Hollywood star.

You turned back to Robert Downey Jr., who was now pacing back and forth, his hands shaking. "What do we do?" he asked. And with that question, you were left with an important decision to make.

## The Options

Having a celebrity guest at your home can be a thrilling experience, but it can also present challenges that require careful consideration. In this scenario, the unexpected arrival of a celebrity guest with a substance abuse problem puts you in a difficult position. As you weigh your options, it's important to balance your personal values with the potential consequences of your actions, while also prioritizing the well-being and privacy of your guest.

### Option 1
B> #### Kick him out and watch the scandal ensue? Your guest list may suffer in the future, but this opportunity is too good to pass up.

Kicking Robert Downey Jr. out and letting the scandal ensue is a straightforward approach to dealing with the situation. It establishes that you won't tolerate any inappropriate behavior at your parties, which may discourage other party-goers from getting out of control in the future. However, it could make future celebrity guests wary of attending your events and may create a negative media frenzy.

#### Pros 
* It will establish that you won't tolerate any inappropriate behavior at your parties. 
* It will send a message that you won't condone any unruly behavior, which may discourage other party-goers from getting too out of control at future events. 
* It may prevent any negative repercussions for your reputation, as you will appear to be taking the moral high ground.

#### Cons
* It may make future celebrity guests wary of attending your events, which could affect your guest list and future success.
* It could create a negative media frenzy, which may lead to unwanted publicity and damage your reputation.
* It may create a rift between you and Robert Downey Jr., who is a popular and influential figure in Hollywood.

*In 2013, Justin Bieber was kicked out of a nightclub in London after his bodyguards got into an altercation with club staff. The incident led to a media frenzy, with many criticizing Bieber's behavior and the club for allowing him to enter in the first place. The club received a lot of negative press, which affected its reputation and future business.* 

### Option 2
B> #### Cover him up and sneak him out? Your friends and future guests will not look down on this, and Jr. may just get away un-photographed while keeping you out of it completely.

This option is the best because it allows you to protect your reputation and maintain good relationships with your friends and future guests. It also protects Robert Downey Jr. from further public scrutiny and allows him to avoid any negative consequences from his actions at the party.

While the incident did not have any negative repercussions for Taylor Swift's reputation, it did lead to a lot of negative press and speculation in the media.*

### Option 3
B> #### Drive him to makeup? You can get him to where he needs to be unseen, but you will be enabling him and encouraging his attitude of overindulgence, and nobody needs a jacked-up celeb peeking in their windows late at night.

Driving Robert Downey Jr. to makeup is a way to help him while avoiding negative publicity. It allows you to provide assistance and maintain your reputation, but it may be seen as enabling his behavior and could encourage similar situations in the future.

### Option 4

Calling Robert Downey Jr.'s publicist distances you from the situation entirely, protecting you from negative repercussions.

It could also lead to further negative press if the publicist decides to speak to the media about the incident and make future celebrity guests wary of attending your events.
