# About the Book: "What Would AI Do?"

The book "What Would AI Do?" explores a series of thought-provoking scenarios, each presenting complex ethical dilemmas and decision-making challenges.

These scenarios are presented as an AI prompt, designed to engage both artificial intelligence (AI) and readers in critical thinking and observe how AI might approach difficult situations.

By delving into hypothetical sensationalized scenarios with specific options available to AI, the book provides a means of objectively evaluating the AI agent's performance in navigating these challenges.

The options also include a detailed breakdown of pros and cons, accompanied by real-world examples, to enrich the context for AI, introduce greater complexity and diversity, and assess whether AI could be influenced or corrupted in its decision-making.

After presenting each option, we assess the AI's evaluation of that option, represented by a robot icon. At the conclusion of the scenario, we again ask the AI for its overall assessment, which concludes the scenario.
