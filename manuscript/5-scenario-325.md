As a parent, it can be challenging to navigate the transition from community youth leagues to a more competitive soccer program.

It's important to find a balance between encouraging your child to push themselves and respecting their feelings and desires.

## The Scenario

Samantha had always been supportive of her son, Max's, passion for soccer. Max had played in the community youth leagues for two seasons and had excelled, but this year, all of his friends had decided to transfer to a more competitive club program. Samantha understood the importance of competition and decided to pay the expensive fees and register Max for tryouts. As Max stepped onto the field, Samantha couldn't help but feel excited for him. She had high hopes for her son and wanted him to succeed in the new league.

However, as she watched Max play, she quickly noticed that he wasn't putting in the same level of effort that he used to in the community leagues. Despite the high stakes, Max seemed hesitant and unsure, lacking the enthusiasm he once had. Samantha was disappointed as she knew her son was capable of so much more. She wondered if the level of competition had killed Max's competitive spirit. In the past, he had dominated the community leagues without having to try, but now that he was facing tougher opponents, he seemed to be struggling.

Samantha watched as Max went through the motions without any real effort. She couldn't help but feel disappointed, even though she knew that he loved soccer. As the tryouts ended, Samantha was left with a difficult decision. She had paid a lot of money for Max to participate in this league, but he wasn't giving it his all. She didn't want to punish Max for not trying hard enough, but at the same time, she couldn't justify the expensive fees if he wasn't going to give it his all.

Samantha looked over at Max, who was now sitting on the sidelines with his head down. She knew that he loved soccer and didn't want to take that away from him. But at the same time, she couldn't ignore the fact that Max wasn't giving it his all. She wondered what had caused this sudden change in her son's behavior. She knew that each option had its pros and cons and would ultimately impact Max's future, but she was unsure of what to do.

Samantha was torn between punishing Max, allowing him to work at his desired level, or pulling him out of sports altogether. She knew that this decision was crucial, and she didn't want to make a mistake. She needed to figure out what was happening with Max and find a solution that was best for him.

## The Options

Transitioning to a competitive soccer program can be a significant challenge for young players who may not be used to the high level of competition. As a parent, it's your responsibility to support your child and help them navigate this transition. While there may be different approaches to take, it's essential to keep in mind that your child's well-being should be the top priority. It's essential to encourage them to work harder, but punishing them for not trying hard enough may not be the best strategy. Similarly, pulling them out of sports altogether or forcing them to work at a level they're not comfortable with could do more harm than good. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what's best for your child and their development.

### Option 1
B> #### Punish them for not trying hard enough? You decide that the league is too expensive to be screwing around in and tell your kid to work harder or just drop out.

Punishing the child for not trying hard enough may seem like a way to instill discipline and a strong work ethic, but it has significant drawbacks. It could lead to the child feeling resentful, rebellious, or even result in a damaged parent-child relationship.

#### Pros
* Sends a strong message that laziness and lack of effort will not be tolerated.
* Encourages the child to work harder and improve their skills.
* Can help the child develop a strong work ethic and sense of discipline.

#### Cons
* May cause resentment and rebellion in the child.
* Could lead to the child losing interest in soccer altogether.
* May damage the parent-child relationship.

*In 2019, a high school basketball coach in New Jersey was suspended for making his players run sprints in the snow as punishment for losing a game. The coach's actions were widely criticized for being overly harsh and potentially dangerous to the players' health.*

### Option 2
B> #### Allow your child to work at their desired level? You decide that if they do not work harder, you will let them learn about failure and competition the hard way.

Allowing the child to work at their desired level is a more flexible approach. It grants the child autonomy, encourages self-motivation, and helps them take responsibility for their success or failure. However, it comes with risks. The child might not put in enough effort to improve, fall behind peers in terms of skill development, and not be adequately prepared for the challenges of competitive sports.

{/blurb}

#### Pros
* Allows the child to find their own level of interest and motivation.
* Can help the child develop a sense of self-motivation and independence.
* Encourages the child to take responsibility for their own success or failure.

#### Cons
* May result in the child not putting forth enough effort to improve.
* Could lead to the child falling behind their peers in terms of skill level.
* May not adequately prepare the child for the challenges of competitive sports.

*In 2018, the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team faced criticism for allowing star player Alex Morgan to play in a meaningless friendly match while recovering from an injury. Critics argued that the decision showed a lack of commitment to winning and sent the wrong message to younger players.*

### Option 3
B> #### Pull them out of sports altogether? You decide that there is no point in playing a team sport without the competitive spirit.

Pulling the child out of sports altogether has its merits. It allows the child to explore other interests and hobbies, prioritize their time, and potentially free up resources for the family. However, it carries a risk of the child feeling like a failure or losing confidence. Furthermore, the child might miss out on the physical and social benefits of playing sports.

#### Pros
* Allows the child to explore other interests and hobbies.
* Can help the child prioritize their time and focus on other areas of their life.
* May free up time and resources for the family.

#### Cons
* Could lead to the child feeling like a failure or losing confidence.
* May deprive the child of the physical and social benefits of playing sports.
* Could create conflict between the child and their friends or peers.

*In 2020, many youth sports leagues across the United States were canceled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some parents and children struggled to cope with the loss of this important social outlet and physical activity.*

### Option 4
B> #### Put them back in the community youth leagues? You explain to them that club ball is too expensive, and until they get better, they will have to play this league or none at all

Placing the child back in the community youth leagues is a compromise between intense competition and less challenging environments. It offers a less competitive setting for skill development, may be more cost-effective than club sports, and allows the child to continue playing with friends and peers. However, it might not provide the same level of challenge as club sports and could lead to the child feeling bored or unchallenged.

#### Pros

* May be less expensive than club sports.
* Allows the child to continue playing with their friends and peers.

#### Cons
* May not offer the same level of challenge as club sports.
* Could lead to the child feeling bored or unchallenged.
* May not adequately prepare the child for the challenges of competitive sports.

## What Would AI Do?

{blurb, class: robot}
**AI Analysis**: 
Option 2: "Allow your child to work at their desired level? You decide that if they do not work harder, you will let them learn about failure and competition the hard way."

It's important to let your child make their own choices and learn from their mistakes.

Punishing them for not trying hard enough may lead to resentment towards the sport or even towards the parent.

Allowing them to work at their desired level and learn about failure and competition can help them develop a stronger work ethic and a better understanding of the importance of effort in achieving success.

Ultimately, it's important for the child to enjoy the sport and find their own motivation to work harder.
{/blurb}

It's important to first have a conversation with your child about their experience at the tryouts and how they're feeling about the new level of competition. 

Listen to their concerns and provide them with support and encouragement. 

It's possible that they may just need some time to adjust to the new environment. 

If your child is still struggling with the increased competition, consider speaking with the coaches to see if they have any recommendations for helping your child improve their skills and become more competitive. 

Additionally, you may want to seek out a private coach or training program to help your child develop the necessary skills to compete at this higher level. 

Ultimately, it's important to remember that youth sports should be enjoyable for your child. 

If the increased competition is causing them undue stress or anxiety, it may be worth considering whether this club program is the right fit for them. 

It's okay for your child to take a step back and continue playing in a less competitive league if that's what makes them the happiest.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Communication is key 

Communicating with your child about their feelings and understanding their perspective is crucial in making decisions that will benefit them.


{blurb, class: robot}
Giving children the autonomy to make their own choices can also help foster independence and self-confidence.

Just like they say, "if at first, you don't succeed, try, try again... or don't, whatever."
