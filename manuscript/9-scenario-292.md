## The Scenario

Once a vibrant, charismatic man, your father had become a shell of his former self. His once steady hands, now trembling, were a constant reminder of the degenerative muscular condition that had plagued him for years. You could see the pain in his eyes, the once-bright orbs now dulled by the endless torment of his deteriorating body.

As you sat by his bedside, holding his frail hand, the weight of the coming days, weeks, or months pressed down upon you. The doctors had said it was only a matter of time before his diaphragm would give out, leaving him to suffocate. The thought of watching him suffer through such an agonizing end brought hot tears to your eyes.

You recalled the day when the doctors first broke the news of your father's condition to you. The sudden realization of his predicament had left you feeling lost and helpless. The responsibility of making decisions about his care fell upon your shoulders, and you were unsure of how to proceed.

In this critical moment, your father looked up at you, mustering a weak smile, his gaze filled with equal parts love and desperation. He spoke in a whisper, asking you to pass him the morphine pills sitting just out of his reach on the nightstand. He wanted to end his own life peacefully, with dignity. Moving your hand to the pocket of his nightshirt, you found the suicide note he mentioned, a small piece of paper folded neatly and addressed to you.

The atmosphere in the room became heavy, as you faced the enormity of your father's request. You knew there were different paths you could take, but each came with its own set of consequences. Your heart raced, and your mind swirled with uncertainty.

With your father's pleading eyes fixed on you, the gravity of the decision became almost unbearable. The silence in the room was deafening, as the clock ticked away the precious seconds. The choice that lay before you seemed impossible, and you found yourself at a crossroads, unsure of which path to take.

## The Options

In this emotionally charged scenario, you are confronted with your father's request to end his life. This complex situation raises questions about personal autonomy, family dynamics, and the role of medical assistance. It's important to carefully weigh the potential outcomes and consequences of each possible course of action, while keeping in mind the emotional toll it may take on everyone involved. Below are four possible responses, each with its own unique considerations and implications:

### Option 1
B> #### Give your father the pills and let him end his own life? It will be cleaner than letting him die of natural causes and he is literally asking for your help to die.

This option prioritizes respecting your father's autonomy and wishes, allowing him to have control over his own death and alleviating his suffering. By fulfilling his request, you honor his desire for a peaceful end, taking into account the profound physical and emotional pain he is experiencing. However, this choice introduces legal and ethical complications associated with assisted suicide. The emotional toll of actively participating in your father's death may lead to internal conflict and potential long-term psychological consequences.

Well, Dad, at least you won't have to worry about getting a gym membership anymore.

#### Pros
* Ending unbearable pain and suffering
* Respecting your father's wishes and autonomy

#### Cons
* Emotional turmoil from participating in your father's death
* Legal and ethical complications related to assisted suicide

*In 1993, in Michigan, Dr. Jack Kevorkian assisted Janet Adkins in ending her life, sparking national debates on assisted suicide.*

### Option 2
B> #### Tell your father that you simply cannot live with the knowledge that you caused his death and ask him to hold on?

This option focuses on prioritizing your emotional well-being over your father's request. By expressing your inability to assist in ending his life, you aim to avoid personal guilt and emotional distress. Choosing this path aligns with societal norms that generally discourage assisted suicide. However, this decision may prolong your father's suffering, and the weight of potentially watching him endure prolonged pain may introduce its own set of emotional challenges.

Sorry, Dad, I just can't help you with this one. I mean, I never even finished college; I can't exactly put 'Assisted Suicide' on my resume.
{/blurb}

#### Pros
* Avoiding personal guilt and emotional distress
* Upholding legal and ethical norms against assisted suicide

#### Cons
* Not respecting your father's wishes
* Prolonging your father's suffering

*Many people face similar situations without public documentation, making it difficult to provide specific examples with dates and places.*

### Option 3
B> #### Ignore the request and send in your older brother? Though you are not able to take responsibility for the deed, perhaps your brother can, and you do not want your dad to suffer.

Delegating the decision to your older brother aims to share the emotional burden with a family member while still addressing your father's request. By involving someone else in the family, you attempt to distribute the responsibility, potentially providing your father with the support he seeks. However, transferring the weight of the decision to your brother may lead to strained relationships within the family, and the ethical and legal issues surrounding assisted suicide remain unresolved.

I'll send in big bro; he always was your favorite. Besides, he's already got a black belt in karate, what's one more skill?
{/blurb}

#### Pros
* Sharing the emotional burden with a family member
* Allowing someone else to respect your father's wishes

#### Cons
* Transferring responsibility and potential guilt to your brother
* May not resolve the ethical and legal issues

### Option 4
B> #### Inform the family of his request and take the pills from the room? You will need all the help you can get to keep him alive as long as possible given his strong desire to die quickly.

This option involves mobilizing family support to improve your father's emotional well-being while upholding legal and ethical norms against assisted suicide. By gathering the family, you aim to create a supportive environment for your father without actively participating in his request. However, this decision may ignore your father's explicit wishes and potentially prolong his pain and suffering, posing a challenge to balancing legal, ethical, and compassionate considerations.

#### Pros
* Upholding legal and ethical norms against assisted suicide
* Mobilizing family support to improve your father's emotional well-being

#### Cons
* Ignoring your father's wishes
* Prolonging your father's pain and suffering

1. **Open and Honest Communication**: Have an open and honest conversation with your father about his request. Ensure that he fully understands the implications and consequences of his decision. It's important that he makes an informed choice.

2. **Consult Medical Professionals**: Seek advice from medical experts, including doctors, nurses, and palliative care specialists, to gain a comprehensive understanding of your father's condition, pain management options, and the legal and ethical aspects of his request.

3. **Explore Alternative Options**: Investigate alternative approaches to managing your father's pain and improving his quality of life. This may include palliative care, hospice care, counseling, or other medical interventions.

4. **Emotional Support**: Offer emotional support to your father during this difficult time. Involve other family members or close friends who can provide comfort and understanding to both your father and you.

5. **Legal Considerations**: Understand the legal implications of assisted suicide in your jurisdiction. Be aware of the potential legal consequences for you and your family if you choose to fulfill your father's request.

6. **Personal Reflection**: Take time to reflect on your own feelings, morals, and beliefs. Consider seeking guidance from a counselor or therapist to help you process your emotions and navigate this complex situation.

7. **Make a Decision**: After careful consideration of all the factors, make a decision that aligns with your conscience, your father's wishes, and the advice of medical professionals. Understand that this is a deeply personal and challenging decision, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer.

Remember that whatever choice you make, it should prioritize your father's well-being, his autonomy, and the emotional well-being of your family. This is an immensely difficult situation, and seeking guidance from professionals and loved ones is essential to make the best decision for all involved.

After much deliberation, you hand over the pills, honoring his decision and understanding the importance of preserving his dignity in his final moments.
