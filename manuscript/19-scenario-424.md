In a world where broken promises have fueled relentless conflict, a dwindling band of Native Americans faces the ultimate decision: continue their desperate flight for freedom or confront the seemingly inevitable.

## The Scenario

Once a proud chief of his tribe, Tókoni had witnessed the world change around him. For more than 30 years, he and his small band of Native Americans had been on the run from both Mexican and American authorities. They had lost patience after numerous promises made to them were broken, and they eventually went on the warpath. Now, Tókoni was one of the last Native Americans still fighting for freedom from the white settlers.

His band was small, a family of about 40 people, including women and children. Tókoni was aware that his age was catching up to him, and he knew that he couldn't run forever. The burden of his people's survival weighed heavily on his shoulders. Their once-vibrant spirits were now subdued, their faces etched with the weariness of a lifetime on the run.

One night, as they huddled around the campfire, Tókoni looked into the eyes of his family and realized that he needed to make a choice. He understood that continuing to run would eventually lead to death by exhaustion for him and his people. But what other options did he have?

As the fire crackled and the night sky filled with stars, Tókoni recalled the stories of his ancestors – warriors who fought valiantly to protect their land and people. He could feel their spirits around him, urging him to decide. But the decision was not an easy one.

As the weight of his options bore down on him, Tókoni looked to the faces of his people, the love and trust they had for him evident in their eyes. He knew that whatever choice he made would impact not only his life but the lives of those who depended on him.

With a heavy heart, Tókoni stared into the dying embers of the fire, wondering what his next move should be. He knew there were options to consider, but he couldn't bring himself to think about them just yet. Instead, he focused on the faces of his loved ones, desperately seeking guidance and strength from their unwavering support.

The following morning, Tókoni gathered his people to discuss their situation. He shared his fears and concerns, acknowledging the reality that running would eventually lead to their demise. As the tribe listened intently, they knew that the time had come for them to make a decision together.

Tókoni could see the anxiety on the faces of his people as they grappled with the reality of their situation. They all understood that their fate rested upon the choice that would be made. As the tribe discussed their options, Tókoni realized that it was up to him to guide them towards the best path for their collective future.

And so, Tókoni listened carefully to his people's thoughts, allowing their words to shape his understanding of the situation. With their input and the wisdom of his ancestors in his heart, he would be better prepared to make the crucial decision that would determine the fate of his tribe.

## The Options

In the unforgiving landscape of the 19th century, Native American leaders faced immense challenges in their quest to secure the wellbeing and future of their people. Caught between the expansionist aspirations of both Mexican and American forces, these leaders had to make difficult decisions that would determine not only their fate but that of their entire community. In such a precarious situation, three potential courses of action emerge: relentlessly evading pursuers, engineering a daring ambush, or negotiating surrender terms. Each choice carries its own risks and consequences, forcing the leader to weigh the options carefully without any guarantee of success or safety.

### Option 1
B> #### Run until you die? You keep your group moving and will only stop when they stop pursuing you or you are killed.

Choosing this option means continuing to evade capture and fight for freedom, even if it leads to eventual death. Run until you die poses significant risks, involving potential exhaustion and death for both the leader and the entire group, which includes women and children. While this choice maintains autonomy and dignity, it comes with the substantial drawback of endangering the well-being of the entire community.

Why did the Native American chief join a marathon? He figured he'd been running from the settlers for 30 years, might as well make a competition out of it.

#### Pros
* Maintain autonomy and dignity
* Continue to resist oppression

#### Cons
* Exhaustion and potential death
* Risk for the entire group, including women and children

*Geronimo, an Apache leader, evaded U.S. troops by fleeing across the U.S.-Mexico border for several years. He was captured and surrendered on September 4, 1886, in Arizona.*

### Option 2
B> #### Set up an ambush? You are certainly signing your own death certificate by turning on your pusuers, but you would rather be killed than captured.

This option involves confronting the pursuers in a final stand, possibly leading to death but maintaining a fighting spirit. Set up an ambush represents a courageous stand that showcases resistance, but it comes at the high cost of almost certain death or capture. While there is the potential to inflict damage on the enemy, the inherent risk to the entire group, including non-combatants, raises ethical concerns and complicates this option's viability.

Why did the Native American chief plan an ambush on his pursuers? He wanted to give them a taste of their own Manifest Destiny.

#### Pros
* Demonstrate courage and resistance
* Potential to inflict damage on the enemy

#### Cons
* Almost certain death or capture
* Risk for the entire group, including non-combatants

*Crazy Horse, a Lakota leader, led his warriors in the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25-26, 1876, in Montana. The Native American forces defeated the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment, led by George Armstrong Custer, but Crazy Horse was later captured and killed in 1877.*

### Option 3
B> #### Surrender? You arrange the terms of your surrender and status as a prisoner of war and finish out your life at the mercy of the U.S. Government.

Surrendering involves negotiating terms with the enemy to ensure the safety and well-being of the group, even if it means living under the control of the U.S. government. Surrender is the recommended choice, as it provides the best chance for the survival and protection of both the family and the remaining members of the band. Opting to surrender may open the door for negotiations with the U.S. Government, potentially leading to better living conditions and allowing the preservation of cultural heritage. Importantly, this option helps avoid further loss of life, considering that continuing to run or engaging in a final stand through an ambush could result in more casualties for the already dwindling group.

**AI Analysis**: 
Option 3: Surrender. This is the best answer because it provides the possibility of survival and protection for your family and the remaining members of your band. Although you would be at the mercy of the U.S. Government, surrendering may enable you to negotiate better living conditions and preserve your cultural heritage. It also prevents further loss of life, as continuing to run or setting up an ambush could result in more casualties.

Surrendering in a challenging situation, especially when faced with conflict or adversity, is a complex decision that requires careful consideration. Here is some general advice on surrendering:

1. **Prioritize Safety and Well-being:**
   - The primary consideration when contemplating surrender is the safety and well-being of yourself and others involved. Assess the risks and potential harm associated with resisting or continuing the conflict.

2. **Negotiate Terms if Possible:**
   - If surrendering is inevitable, attempt to negotiate favorable terms that ensure the safety, dignity, and rights of those involved. Open communication and diplomacy can sometimes lead to better outcomes.

3. **Avoid Further Violence:**
   - Choosing to surrender can help prevent further violence and loss of life. It may contribute to de-escalation and create an opportunity for resolution through dialogue rather than confrontation.

4. **Consider Long-Term Consequences:**
   - Evaluate the potential long-term consequences of surrendering, such as the impact on autonomy, freedom, and overall quality of life. Assess whether surrendering aligns with your values and goals.

5. **Understand the Terms of Surrender:**
   - Clearly understand the terms and conditions of surrender before making a decision. Be cautious of potential mistreatment or broken promises. Seek legal advice if necessary to ensure your rights are protected.

6. **Preserve Cultural Heritage:**
   - In situations involving cultural or historical significance, surrender might be a pragmatic choice to preserve cultural heritage. This could involve negotiations to safeguard traditions, practices, and the identity of a community.

7. **Learn From Historical Examples:**
   - Study historical examples of surrender to gain insights into the outcomes and lessons learned. Understanding the experiences of others who have faced similar decisions can provide valuable perspectives.

8. **Maintain Dignity and Resilience:**
   - Regardless of the circumstances, aim to maintain personal dignity and resilience. Surrendering does not diminish one's worth, and finding ways to endure and rebuild is a testament to strength.

9. **Seek Support and Guidance:**
   - Consult with trusted advisors, legal experts, or community leaders to seek support and guidance. Collective decision-making can contribute to a more informed and comprehensive assessment of the situation.

10. **Plan for the Future:**
    - If surrendering is the chosen path, consider creating a plan for the future. This may involve adapting to changed circumstances, rebuilding, and working towards positive change.

Remember that each situation is unique, and the decision to surrender should be based on careful consideration of the specific circumstances. Seek professional advice and support when needed, and prioritize the safety, well-being, and dignity of all involved parties.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Stand up for your beliefs, but also consider the consequences for yourself and others. 

It's important to fight for what you believe in, but sometimes, the best course of action is to balance your beliefs with the well-being of those you care about. In the face of adversity, consider the impact of your decisions on the people around you, and if necessary, make sacrifices for the greater good.

Tókoni, as the leader, gathered his people and explained his decision to surrender, emphasizing the need to prioritize their survival, protect their families, and preserve their culture.

After much contemplation, Tókoni finally decided to surrender, hoping that the U.S. Government would at least provide them with a decent reservation. As they were escorted to their new home, he couldn't help but chuckle at the irony: after all these years, they would finally stop running, only to be imprisoned by the same people who had stolen their land.

Well, at least they'll have three meals a day and a roof over their heads. Can't say the same for the rest of us
