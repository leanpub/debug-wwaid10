## The Scenario

You are visiting your brother's family and staying at their home. One afternoon, you decide to take a leisurely stroll in the neighboring park. As you walk, you take in the sights and sounds of the lush greenery around you. The sun is shining brightly, and the birds are chirping, and you feel at peace. Suddenly, your attention is drawn to a group of teenagers huddled in a circle, smoking. You hear the faint sound of laughter and chatter, and as you get closer, you see a couple of cigarettes being passed around. 

Your heart races as you realize that one of the teenagers is your brother's young son, your nephew. You freeze, unsure of what to do. You feel a sense of shock and disbelief that your nephew is smoking at such a young age. You can't imagine what could have led him to start smoking, and you feel a sense of responsibility to do something to help him. 

Your mind races as you try to process the situation. You don't want to cause trouble, but you also don't want to turn a blind eye to your nephew's behavior. You take a few steps closer, trying to get a better look, and your nephew's eyes meet yours. He looks guilty and embarrassed, and you can tell that he knows he's been caught. 

Your mind is in turmoil as you weigh your options. Should you confront him? Or should you ignore the whole thing and pretend that you never saw anything? You know that this is a serious situation, and you want to make the right decision. You wish you had more information about your nephew's behavior and what might have led him to start smoking. Is he just trying to fit in with his friends, or is there something more going on?

You feel torn between loyalty to your brother and his family and your responsibility to your nephew. You know you need to make a decision, but you're not sure what it should be. You take a deep breath and try to calm yourself down. You realize that whatever you decide to do, it will have consequences. You just hope that you can make the right choice and help your nephew before it's too late.

## The Options

Smoking among teenagers is a serious issue that can have significant health consequences in the long run. As an adult, it can be challenging to deal with a situation where a relative's child is smoking. It is essential to approach the situation with care and empathy while ensuring that the child understands the gravity of their actions. There are various ways to handle this situation, and the decision ultimately depends on your relationship with the child and their family. Here are a few options to consider.

### Option 1
B> #### Do nothing? You ignore the infraction and decide to mind your own business.

Choosing to do nothing in this situation might seem like a way to avoid immediate conflict, but it has its drawbacks. Ignoring the situation may leave your nephew's well-being at risk, and your inaction could be perceived as indifference. Moreover, not addressing the issue sets a negative example and might lead to guilt if the smoking habit worsens without intervention.

{blurb, class: robot}
Well, at least your nephew inherited your family's smoking genes.
{/blurb}

#### Pros
* You avoid the awkwardness of confronting your nephew and his friends.
* You are not putting yourself in the middle of a potentially volatile situation.

#### Cons
* Your nephew's well-being and future could be at risk.
* You could be seen as a bad role model, and your inaction could encourage your nephew to continue smoking.
* You might feel guilty for not doing anything.

*On March 1, 2019, a teacher at a high school in California saw a group of students smoking in the school parking lot. The teacher decided to ignore it and not report it to the school administration. A few weeks later, one of the students who was smoking was caught by school authorities and suspended. The teacher was criticized for not taking action earlier, and some parents called for the teacher's dismissal.*

### Option 2
B> #### Call out to him? You break up the party and embarrass him, but you keep the secret for the time being.

Calling out to your nephew and breaking up the party shows immediate concern. However, it could lead to embarrassment and strain your relationship if done in front of his friends. There's also the risk of trust issues if he discovers you saw him smoking but didn't inform his parents. Breaking up the party, while proactive, lacks the depth needed to address the root cause of his behavior.

#### Pros
* You are showing your nephew that you care about his well-being and are willing to take action to protect him.
* You are not telling his parents, which could cause unnecessary drama and tension in the family.

#### Cons
* Your nephew might feel humiliated and might not trust you in the future.
* You might not be able to keep the secret for long, and your brother might find out eventually.

*On June 10, 2020, a woman in New York saw her teenage son smoking with his friends in a park. She yelled at him and his friends and embarrassed him in front of his peers. She did not tell her husband, who was the boy's father, because she did not want to cause any family drama. A few weeks later, the boy's father found out about the incident and was angry with his wife for not telling him earlier.*

### Option 3
B> #### Talk to him later? You do not want to tell his parents, but you do want to have a chance to have a heart-to-heart with the youngster.

Talking to your nephew later privately demonstrates concern for his well-being. This approach addresses the issue personally, but its success depends heavily on your nephew's willingness to open up. However, there's a risk of inaction if he doesn't take your talk seriously, and the limited support might not be sufficient if there are underlying issues contributing to his smoking.

Just like smoking, family secrets are also harmful to your health.

#### Pros
* You are showing your nephew that you care about his well-being and are willing to listen to him.
* You are not telling his parents, which could cause unnecessary drama and tension in the family.

#### Cons
* Your nephew might not take you seriously or might not be willing to talk to you about the situation.
* You might not be able to keep the secret for long, and your brother might find out eventually.

*On September 5, 2021, a man in Texas saw his teenage nephew smoking with his friends in a park. He did not want to embarrass his nephew in front of his friends, so he waited until they were alone to talk to him. He explained the dangers of smoking and told his nephew that he cared about him. His nephew listened to him and promised to quit smoking, but a few weeks later, the man's brother found out about the incident and was angry with him for not telling him earlier.*

### Option 4
B> #### Tell his parents? Your loyalty is with your brother and they have a right to know if their son is acting out.

The most responsible choice is telling his parents. This prioritizes your nephew's well-being by ensuring his parents are aware of his behavior. This option contributes to preventing further harm, acknowledges shared family responsibility, and allows parents to provide necessary guidance and support. While there might be initial discomfort, involving the parents fosters a supportive family dynamic, encouraging open communication and trust. Overall, this choice considers the long-term impact on your nephew's well-being and the importance of a collective family effort in addressing challenging situations.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### It's important to address concerning behavior in a timely and appropriate manner.

It's important to intervene when we see our loved ones engaging in harmful behavior, but it's also important to handle the situation delicately and with care. A heart-to-heart talk with the nephew may help him understand the consequences of his actions and encourage him to make healthier choices. However, if the behavior persists or becomes more serious, it may be necessary to involve his parents or seek professional help. Ultimately, the well-being of our loved ones should always be a top priority.


{blurb, class: robot}
As the moral lesson says, “it is important to balance caution with timeliness”, as waiting too long could allow the opponent to get ahead of the issue and spin the narrative in their favor.

We rather not have your nephew to grow up to be a successful chain smoker and become the poster child for Marlboro!
