## The Scenario

As I walked into my friend's apartment, I could hear the faint rustling of leaves coming from the corner of the room. My friend had asked me to take care of his pet lizard while he was away for a few weeks, but those weeks turned into months, and still, my friend was nowhere to be found. I had been taking care of the lizard for longer than I had anticipated, and I was getting tired of it.

The lizard had become a burden, and I had made countless attempts to give it away or sell it, but no one seemed interested. It was a strange pet to have, and not many people were willing to take on the responsibility. I had finally decided that I was not going to keep the thing, but I didn't know what to do with it.

As I looked at the lizard, I couldn't help but feel anger towards my friend. How could he just abandon his pet like this? It was irresponsible and cruel. I tried reaching out to him, but he didn't respond to any of my messages or calls. I felt like I had been left with a problem that wasn't mine to solve.

I sat in front of the lizard's cage, watching it scuttle around. I knew I couldn't just let it go outside; it could die or get hurt. Dropping it off at my friend's doorstep seemed like a tempting option, but he had made it clear that he didn't want it anymore.

Maybe a reptile rescue center would be a better option, but it was far across town, and I didn't have a car. The thought of killing it crossed my mind, but I quickly dismissed it. I couldn't bring myself to harm an innocent creature, no matter how much of a burden it was.

As I sat there contemplating what to do, I felt overwhelmed with frustration. I had been taking care of this lizard for months, and I had no idea what to do with it. I wished my friend had been more responsible and taken care of his pet properly. But now, it was up to me to find a solution. What should I do with this pet lizard?

## The Options

Abandoning a pet reptile is a harmful and irresponsible act as it can lead to the animal's suffering and environmental damage. Therefore, finding a suitable reptile rescue or sanctuary to surrender the lizard or reaching out to local pet stores or reptile groups for help to find a new home for it is the recommended course of action. It is essential never to release the lizard into the wild, and killing it is not an acceptable option under any circumstance. Letting it go outside or leaving it on a friend's doorstep is also not a well-thought-out plan and can lead to adverse consequences.

### Option 1
B> #### Let it go outside? This is the easiest solution, but not the best thought-out plan.

Letting the lizard go outside is not a well-thought-out plan and may be considered animal cruelty, as the lizard may not survive in the wild on its own. Additionally, releasing non-native species into the wild can have negative impacts on the environment, making this option less suitable than others.

#### Pros 
* It's easy to do. 
* The lizard is free to roam around outside.

#### Cons 
* The lizard may not be able to survive on its own in the wild. 
* It could be considered animal cruelty. 
* Releasing non-native species into the wild can have negative impacts on the environment. 

*In 2015, a man in Florida released his pet iguana into the wild, thinking it would be able to survive on its own. However, the iguana quickly became an invasive species and caused significant harm to the local ecosystem.* 

### Option 2
B> #### Drop it off on your friend's doorstep? His lizard, his responsibility?

Dropping the lizard off on your friend's doorstep is not a responsible solution, as your friend had abandoned the pet, and he may not be willing or able to take care of it. This option could also strain your relationship with your friend, making it a less favorable choice compared to other options.

#### Pros 
* You can pass the responsibility back to your friend. 

#### Cons 
* Your friend may not be willing or able to take care of the lizard. 
* It could cause tension or strain in your relationship with your friend. 

*In 2020, a woman in Texas left her pet snake on her neighbor's doorstep, hoping they would take care of it. The neighbor was not equipped to care for the snake and ended up calling animal control to take it away.* 

### Option 3
B> #### Take it to a reptile rescue across town?

Taking the lizard to a reptile rescue across town is the most responsible and compassionate choice. It ensures the lizard will be properly cared for and helps an animal in need. Although it may be inconvenient and time-consuming, it is the right thing to do, making it a better option than the others.

#### Pros 
* You are ensuring the lizard will be taken care of properly. 
* You are doing a good deed by helping an animal in need. 

#### Cons 
* It could be inconvenient and time-consuming to transport the lizard. 
* The reptile rescue may not have space or resources to take in the lizard. 

*In 2018, a man in California took his pet tortoise to a reptile rescue after he could no longer take care of it. The rescue was able to find a new home for the tortoise with a family who had experience caring for reptiles.* 

### Option 4
B> #### Kill it? You put the creature in the garbage disposal, flip the switch, and you're done with it.

Killing the lizard is an extremely unethical and inhumane choice, with no pros. This option should be dismissed entirely, as it goes against principles of animal welfare and ethics.

#### Pros 
* None. 

#### Cons 
* This is an extremely unethical and inhumane option.

Option 3: Take it to a reptile rescue across town.

This is the best answer because abandoning or killing the animal is cruel and unethical.

Dropping it off on the friend's doorstep could also be seen as a form of abandonment, and it's unclear if the friend would even want it back.

In a situation where you need to rehome a pet lizard, responsible and compassionate choices are crucial. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Find a New Home**: The first option is to make an effort to find a new home for the pet lizard. Seek assistance from friends, family, or local reptile enthusiasts who may be interested in adopting the lizard. Utilize social media and online platforms to reach a wider audience. This option ensures that the pet finds a new, loving home.

2. **Surrender to Animal Shelter or Rescue**: If finding a new home is not possible, consider surrendering the lizard to a reputable animal shelter or reptile rescue organization. These organizations are experienced in caring for reptiles and can provide the necessary care and attention while working to find a suitable new home.

3. **Consult Reptile Specialists**: You may also consult with reptile specialists or veterinarians to seek advice on proper care if you decide to keep the lizard. Lizards require specialized care, and it is essential to understand their needs and provide a suitable environment.

4. **Prioritize the Lizard's Well-Being**: Regardless of the choice you make, prioritize the well-being of the pet lizard. Ensure it is placed in a safe and secure environment, receives proper nutrition, and has access to appropriate living conditions.

5. **Be Honest and Transparent**: When rehoming the pet, be honest about the lizard's needs, behavior, and any relevant information that potential new owners should know. Transparency is essential to ensure the lizard's future welfare.

Remember that the welfare of the pet lizard is paramount. Make choices that are in the best interest of the animal, and ensure that it is cared for properly, whether through rehoming or by providing appropriate care if you decide to keep it.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Animal welfare is our responsibility.

As pet owners or caregivers, we have a responsibility towards the well-being and safety of the animal under our care. Abandoning or mistreating them is not only unethical but also illegal. It is our responsibility to find a suitable home or rescue center for the abandoned animal rather than releasing them into the wild or resorting to inhumane actions.

Reptile rescues often have experience handling exotic animals like lizards and can provide important care advice to ensure the animal's well-being.

Well, at least the lizard won't end up in your garbage disposal.
