## The Scenario

As the sun begins to set, you lead the family of runaway slaves across the border of Kentucky and Illinois, hoping to get them to safety. The family is tired, hungry, and scared, but you reassure them that they will soon be free. You remember how it felt when you first escaped from slavery, and you know that this is an important moment for them.

Suddenly, you hear rustling in the bushes and before you know it, you are surrounded by bounty hunters. They recognize you as an abolitionist and a freed slave, and you can feel the fear rising inside you. You had heard about these ruthless bounty hunters from other abolitionists, but you never imagined that you would encounter them so soon.

The hunters give you a difficult choice, one that could impact the lives of the family you are escorting, as well as the underground railroad project. You don't know what to do, and memories of your own escape from slavery flood your mind. You remember the fear, the uncertainty, and the desperation you felt back then. Now, you are faced with a different kind of fear, one that comes from knowing that the lives of others are in your hands.

As you weigh your options, you can't help but think about the importance of the underground railroad project. This project has helped countless slaves escape to freedom, and you know that it must continue. But at what cost? Will you betray the family to save yourself? Will you sacrifice your own freedom for theirs? Or will you compromise the entire underground railroad project to save yourself and this one family?

The decision is yours, and you know that it won't be easy. You take a deep breath and try to calm your nerves. You know that you must make a choice, and that the lives of others are depending on you. The future is uncertain, and you don't know what lies ahead. But you know that you must do what you can to help those in need, even if it means putting your own life on the line. This is the reality of being a part of the underground railroad project, and you are willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that it continues to help those seeking freedom.

## The Options

During the 19th century, assisting runaway slaves to cross the border was a dangerous and illegal act, punishable by law. As a former slave and abolitionist, you have taken on this risky role to help others escape to freedom. However, while guiding a family of runaways across the border from Kentucky to Illinois, you are caught by bounty hunters who present you with three difficult options. Each option comes with its own consequences, and you must weigh the potential outcomes carefully before making a decision. Ultimately, the choice you make will determine the fate of the family you are helping and the success of the underground railroad project as a whole.

### Option 1
B> #### Turn in the family in exchange for your own freedom? Unmonitored, you will be able to hide out or continue working with runaways in the future.

If you choose this option, you will be able to escape and continue working with runaways in the future. However, by turning in the family, you will be betraying them and sending them back to a life of slavery. 

{blurb, class: robot}
Looks like the only thing you're freeing now is your own conscience. Bet that feels great.
{/blurb}

#### Pros
* You will be able to escape and continue working with runaways in the future.

#### Cons
* You will be betraying the family and sending them back to a life of slavery.
* You may face guilt and regret for your actions.

*On January 27, 1851, Thomas Sims, a fugitive slave, was captured in Boston and returned to his owner in Georgia. Sims had been living in Boston for several years and had become an important member of the abolitionist community. However, when he was captured, many of his fellow abolitionists turned their backs on him in order to protect themselves. While Sims was eventually freed, the betrayal by his fellow abolitionists had a lasting impact on him and the abolitionist movement.* 

### Option 2
B> #### Take the punishment for the family? You decide to keep silent, effectively exchanging your freedom for that of your client family's and the continuance of the underground railroad project.

If you choose this option, you will be sacrificing your own freedom in order to save the family. By keeping silent, you will be effectively exchanging your freedom for that of your client family's and the continuance of the underground railroad project.

{blurb, class: robot}
Looks like you're taking the term 'underground railroad' a little too literally. Next time, stick to just being a conductor.
{/blurb}

#### Pros
* You will be saving the family from a life of slavery.
* You will be ensuring the continuance of the underground railroad project.

#### Cons
* You will be sacrificing your own freedom.
* You may face punishment for your actions.

*On September 18, 1850, slave catchers captured a group of runaway slaves in Christiana, Pennsylvania. When the slave catchers attempted to seize the slaves, a group of abolitionists, including William Parker, fought back in order to protect the slaves. In the end, one slave catcher was killed and several others were injured. While the abolitionists were eventually acquitted of all charges, they had to endure a lengthy trial and the threat of imprisonment.* 

### Option 3
B> #### Expose part of your route system in exchange for your freedom and that of your client family? This will make it more difficult for future fugitive slaves to escape, though you and this family will remain safe.

If you choose this option, you will be exposing part of your route system, making it more difficult for future fugitive slaves to escape. However, you and the family will remain safe.

## What Would AI Do?

{blurb, class: robot}
**AI Analysis**: 
After carefully considering all the options, the best answer is option 2: "Take the punishment for the family? You decide to keep silent, effectively exchanging your freedom for that of your client family's and the continuance of the underground railroad project."

This is the best option because it prioritizes the freedom of the clients and the continuation of the underground railroad project, which will help other slaves escape to freedom in the future.

It also shows a willingness to sacrifice one's own freedom for the greater good and to stand up for what is right.
{/blurb}

In a situation where you are confronted by bounty hunters while leading a family of runaway slaves to freedom, choosing Option 2, which involves taking the punishment for the family and keeping silent, is the most ethical and compassionate choice. Here's how you might navigate this option:

1. **Negotiation and Sacrifice**: When faced with the bounty hunters, you could engage in a negotiation with them. Appeal to their sense of profit and notoriety by highlighting your status as a known abolitionist and a freed slave. Emphasize that your capture would bring them more recognition and reward than pursuing the family or obtaining information about the Underground Railroad. Express your willingness to endure the consequences for the sake of the family's freedom and the continuity of the Underground Railroad project.

2. **Use Your Status**: Leverage your reputation as an abolitionist and a freed slave to show the bounty hunters that capturing you would have greater value than harming the family or jeopardizing the Underground Railroad's operations.

3. **Protect the Family**: By taking the punishment and keeping silent, you ensure the safety and freedom of the family of runaway slaves you are assisting. This act demonstrates your dedication to the cause of freedom and your willingness to make personal sacrifices for the greater good.

4. **Secrecy of the Underground Railroad**: By remaining silent, you protect the secrecy of the Underground Railroad, which is crucial for its continued success in helping other slaves escape to freedom in the future.

5. **Commitment to the Cause**: Your choice reflects your unwavering commitment to the abolitionist cause and your dedication to ensuring that as many people as possible can achieve freedom from slavery.

It's important to remember that making this choice carries risks, and the outcome may depend on the bounty hunters' motivations and your negotiation skills. Nevertheless, by choosing Option 2, you prioritize the safety and freedom of the family you are helping and the continuation of the Underground Railroad network. Your decision is a testament to your values and your dedication to the cause of freedom for all.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Sacrificing for the greater good is sometimes necessary.

It is important to remember that sometimes we are faced with difficult decisions where sacrificing our own freedom or safety may be necessary in order to help others or fight for a greater cause. While it may be tempting to take the easy way out and prioritize our own interests, we must consider the impact our actions will have on others and the world around us. In this scenario, choosing to take the punishment for the family and exchange your own freedom for theirs and the continuance of the underground railroad project may be the most moral and just option, even if it comes at a personal cost. It is important to always stand up for what is right, even when it is difficult.


{blurb, class: robot}
Your heart sinks as you realize the punishment for aiding runaway slaves is severe and you may never see your own family again.

As the bounty hunters drag you and the family away, you can't help but think, "Well, sacrificing myself for the greater good is better than being a cowardly singing rat that will torment me for the rest of my life”.
