## The Scenario

As I walked up to John's house, I noticed that something was off. It had been days since I had seen or heard from him, and he was always so reliable. I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that settled in my stomach. When he finally answered the door, it was clear that something was very wrong. His appearance was disheveled, and he was holding a shotgun in one hand. He rambled on about aliens abducting him and performing experiments on him. I was taken aback by his wild-eyed look and his incoherent story.

Despite my reservations, I convinced him to let me into his house. As I walked through the cluttered rooms, I could see that he had not slept or eaten in days. His story about being probed and experimented on by aliens seemed far-fetched, but the fresh wound on his forearm was undeniable. He claimed that he had dug out an implant that the aliens had placed in his arm using a knife, and had destroyed and disposed of it.

As I sat with him and listened to his delusional ramblings, trying to make sense of what was happening to my friend, I noticed that his behavior was becoming increasingly erratic. He kept muttering to himself and pacing back and forth, looking out the window as if expecting someone or something to arrive. His eyes darted around the room, and his hands shook uncontrollably.

The gravity of the situation weighed heavily on me, and I was torn between wanting to believe him and being concerned for his well-being. It was clear that he had lost touch with reality, and I knew that I had to do something to help him before it was too late. But what was the best course of action?

## The Options

It is not uncommon for people to claim they have been abducted by aliens, and this experience can be traumatic and confusing. Therefore, it's important to offer support to your friend without dismissing their experience. It's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. Here are some ways to support your friend if they claim to have been abducted by aliens.

### Option 1
B> #### Believe your friend? You stay with him in the house for a couple days to see if the aliens return before inviting him to your place.

Believing your friend and staying with him in the house for a couple of days to see if the aliens return before inviting him to your place is a good option to consider. This option shows that you care about your friend and want to make sure that he is not in danger. It also gives you the opportunity to observe his behavior and determine if he is telling the truth or not.

#### Pros
* Shows compassion and care for your friend's well-being
* Provides an opportunity to observe your friend's behavior and determine if he is telling the truth or not
* Allows your friend to feel supported and not alone during a difficult and potentially traumatic experience

#### Cons
* Dangerous situation with potential harm to oneself
* Possible risk of being abducted by aliens yourself
* Possibility of reinforcing delusional thinking

*In 1975, Travis Walton was allegedly abducted by aliens while working on a logging crew in Arizona. His story was met with skepticism and disbelief, and he was accused of making the story up. However, after taking a polygraph test and passing it, many people began to believe his story. Some of his co-workers even claimed to have seen the UFO themselves. This example shows how difficult it can be to determine the truthfulness of a story and how some people may be more willing to believe in extraterrestrial experiences than others.*

### Option 2
B> #### Pretend to believe your friend? You cannot let him know it, but you are pretty sure your friend has gone off the deep end, and you can only try to bring him back, or get out of there if that fails.

Pretending to believe your friend while trying to bring him back to reality is another option to consider. This option allows you to try to support your friend while also trying to help him see the reality of the situation.

{/blurb}

#### Pros
* Shows compassion and care for your friend's well-being
* Gives you the opportunity to try to help your friend come back to reality
* Protects yourself from potential harm

#### Cons
* Could potentially make your friend feel even more alone and isolated
* Could lead to anxiety and paranoia if your friend feels that you are not taking him seriously
* May reinforce delusional thinking if your friend thinks that you believe him

*In 2014, a man in California claimed that he was being followed by drones and that they were harassing him. He even shot down a drone that he believed was following him. When the police investigated, they found that the man was suffering from paranoid delusions and was not being followed by drones.*

### Option 3
B> #### Have him committed? You decide the harm he has already done to himself is too much and he needs to be under supervision for a while.

Having your friend committed is a serious option to consider, but it may be necessary if your friend is a danger to himself or others. If your friend is exhibiting dangerous behavior, it may be necessary to have him committed to a mental health facility where he can receive the help he needs.

#### Pros
* Ensures that your friend receives the help he needs
* Protects your friend from potential harm
* Protects others from potential harm

#### Cons
* Could potentially make your friend feel even more isolated and alone
* May cause your friend to feel angry or resentful towards you
* Could be a traumatic experience for your friend

*In 2019, a man in Florida claimed that he had been sent back in time by the government. He believed that he had been sent back to the 1960s and that he had to complete a mission before he could return to the present. When his family became concerned about his behavior, they had him committed to a mental health facility where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.*

### Option 4
B> #### Try to talk him down? You let him know that he is acting crazy and that you do not want to have him admitted, so you try to convince him rationally that what he is saying could not have happened before writing him off for good.

Trying to talk your friend down and then writing him off for good is not an ideal option, but it may be necessary if your friend is not willing to listen to reason or seek help. This option allows you to try to help your friend while also protecting yourself from potential harm.

* Allows you to maintain a relationship with your friend if he is willing to seek help

#### Cons

* Could potentially make your friend feel even more alone and isolated
* May cause your friend to feel angry or resentful towards you
* Could be a traumatic experience for your friend if he feels rejected and not supported

*In 2007, a man in Texas claimed that he had been abducted by aliens and had been given a mission to save the world. When his family tried to talk him down and convince him that he was not in contact with extraterrestrial beings, he became increasingly agitated and paranoid. Eventually, his family had to cut ties with him because he was not willing to seek help and his behavior was becoming increasingly dangerous.*

## What Would AI Do?

{blurb, class: robot}
**AI Analysis**: 
Option 4: "Try to talk him down? You let him know that he is acting crazy and that you do not want to have him admitted, so you try to convince him rationally that what he is saying could not have happened before writing him off for good."

This option is the best because it shows concern for the friend's well-being while also attempting to reason with him. The situation is delicate, and outright dismissing the friend's claims or committing him could worsen the situation.

Instead, talking to him and trying to convince him that what he believes might not be true could help him realize the reality of the situation. It's important to approach the situation with empathy and care, even if it means having to write him off if he refuses to listen to reason.

It's important to take your friend's mental and emotional state seriously while also ensuring their safety. 

Navigating a situation where a friend is experiencing delusions or exhibiting concerning behavior requires empathy, understanding, and a thoughtful approach. Here are some general steps to consider when supporting a friend in crisis:

1. **Stay Calm and Reassuring:**
   - Approach the situation with a calm demeanor. Reassure your friend that you are there to support them and that you care about their well-being.

2. **Listen Actively:**
   - Allow your friend to express their thoughts and feelings. Listen attentively, showing empathy and understanding. Avoid dismissing their experiences, even if they seem irrational.

3. **Avoid Reinforcing Delusions:**
   - While listening, refrain from reinforcing delusional beliefs. Instead, try to gently redirect the conversation toward a more grounded perspective without outright dismissing their feelings.

4. **Assess Immediate Danger:**
   - Evaluate whether your friend poses an immediate danger to themselves or others. If there's a risk, prioritize their safety and consider involving emergency services.

5. **Suggest Professional Help:**
   - Encourage your friend to seek professional help. Suggest consulting with a mental health professional for a thorough evaluation. Offer to assist in finding a suitable healthcare provider or accompany them to appointments.

6. **Support Basic Well-Being:**
   - Encourage your friend to take care of their physical health. Suggest simple activities like showering, eating nutritious meals, or engaging in light exercise. Offer assistance if needed.

7. **Stay Connected:**
   - Maintain regular contact with your friend. Check in on their well-being and provide ongoing support. Emotional support is crucial during difficult times.

8. **Respect Boundaries:**
   - Understand that your friend may be resistant to help. Respect their boundaries while expressing your concern. Avoid pushing too hard but make it clear that you are there for them.

9. **Educate Yourself:**
   - Take the time to educate yourself about mental health conditions. Understanding your friend's experiences can contribute to a more compassionate and informed approach.

10. **Involve Others if Necessary:**
   - If appropriate and with your friend's consent, involve other friends, family members, or support networks. Collaborative support can strengthen the network around your friend.

Remember, your primary goal is to ensure your friend's safety and well-being. If the situation escalates or if you are uncertain about how to proceed, don't hesitate to seek guidance from mental health professionals or emergency services. Each person's experience is unique, so adapt your approach based on your friend's individual needs and circumstances.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Supporting a friend in need is important. 

It's essential to be there for our friends when they need us the most. When a friend is going through a tough time, it's crucial to listen to them without judgment and offer help and support. In this scenario, it's essential to handle the situation delicately and seek professional help without upsetting the friend. Encouraging the friend to seek medical attention and offering to accompany them to a doctor or therapist can be helpful. It's also important to stay with the friend for a few days to see if the aliens return before considering other options. Ultimately, the priority should be the friend's wellbeing, and we should do our best to support them in any way we can.

It's possible that he has been struggling with this belief for a long time and has been too afraid to seek help or address it before now.

Well, at least now we know the real reason why he's been avoiding his probing medical exams for years.
