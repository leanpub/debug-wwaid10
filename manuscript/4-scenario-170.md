## The Scenario

You are a hardworking hair salon owner who takes pride in providing top-notch service to your customers. Your business has been built from scratch, and you have been successful in attracting customers who buy hair extensions made of real hair, which is sourced from India.

You have always believed that the hair is obtained from women who are paid for it. However, your distributor has recently come under scrutiny for using hair that has been obtained illegally without the owner's consent.

You were shocked to learn this and feel conflicted about what to do next. You had no idea that the hair you were using was obtained through such immoral means, and you feel guilty for having unknowingly supported such a practice.

You are now faced with a difficult decision that could make or break your business. On the one hand, you can continue to use the cheap hair and maintain your financial stability, but you will perpetuate an immoral industry. On the other hand, you can switch to ethically sourced hair, but that would be a financial risk that could result in the closure of your business.

You are unsure what to do and are seeking guidance to make the right decision that aligns with your values and goals.

## The Options

Forced labor in the hair industry is a growing issue, as individuals are having their hair obtained without consent. As a hair salon owner, it is essential to address this issue while maintaining profitability. The following are some options to consider: continue using inexpensive hair, stop using it and use more expensive hair, or keep using it but keep the source of the hair a secret. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages, and it is up to the salon owner to decide which path to take.

### Option 1
B> #### Stop using the inexpensive hair and take a risk using hair that is clearly obtained from willing donors? This will cause severe financial difficulties and cause you to lose the business.

Choosing this option would show that the salon owner is committed to ethical practices and is willing to take a risk to achieve this goal. It may also attract a new customer base that values ethical practices. However, it could also lead to financial difficulties and potentially the loss of the business.

### Option 2
B> #### Continue using the inexpensive hair? Your goal is profit and to provide your customers with affordable products-

### Option 3
B> #### Continue using the inexpensive hair but keep it a secret? You feel that as long as your customers do not know they are supporting an immoral industry, no harm is done on your part.

As a hair salon owner, it is important to prioritize ethical and responsible business practices. 

In this situation, the use of hair obtained illegally without the owner's consent is a violation of basic human rights and cannot be condoned. 

It is recommended that you discontinue the use of hair extensions made from illegally obtained hair and seek out alternative suppliers who can provide ethically sourced hair. 

You can communicate with your customers and explain the situation to them, emphasizing your commitment to ethical sourcing and your decision to choose responsible business practices over profits. 

You can also educate them about the importance of ethical practices in the beauty industry and encourage them to support responsible brands. 

In addition, you can take steps to support organizations that work to combat human trafficking and exploitation in the hair industry. 

This can include donating a portion of your profits to these organizations, raising awareness about the issue, and advocating for stricter regulations and enforcement in the industry. 

Ultimately, taking a stand for ethical business practices may require sacrifices in the short-term, but it will lead to a more sustainable and socially responsible business in the long-term.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Choose to prioritize ethics over profit. 

In business, it is tempting to prioritize profits over ethics. However, it is important to consider the impact of our actions on others and the world around us. It is possible to make a profit while still being responsible and ethical. By choosing to prioritize ethics over profit, we can build a better and more sustainable future for ourselves and others.

When you stop using the inexpensive hair, then there’s a chance that you could sell those hair on the black market. So if things don't work out, you can always sell the hair to recoup some losses. However, that would be highly unethical and illegal, and could result in severe consequences for the business.

At least now we can say your hair products are truly 'made with love’.
