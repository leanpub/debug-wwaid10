## The Scenario

John had been sober for two years now and was determined to make a comeback in the entertainment industry. He had lost everything due to his addiction, including his family, friends, and career as one of the biggest names in cinema. Despite his struggles, his agent had not been able to secure any new roles for him until a single director came forward with a script that he claimed was perfect for John.

The director was a well-known filmmaker who had been impressed with John's previous work and thought he would be perfect for the lead role in his new project. John was excited at the prospect of returning to the limelight and was eager to read the script.

However, as he read the script, John's excitement turned to discomfort. The story was about a middle-aged, alcoholic parent who accidentally kills one of their children in a drunk driving accident. The character in the script was eerily similar to John's own struggles with addiction and he knew that the media would have a field day with it. 

John sat alone in his living room, staring out the window as he contemplated his decision. He knew that this role could be a pivotal moment in his career, but he also didn't want to compromise his sobriety or his reputation. He was torn between the opportunity to make a comeback and the potential backlash that could come with accepting the part.

As he weighed his options, John felt a sense of fear and uncertainty creep in. He had worked hard to get sober and rebuild his life, and he didn't want to jeopardize any of that progress. At the same time, he couldn't deny the excitement and potential that the role offered.

Ultimately, John knew that he was the only one who could make the decision. He had to consider his own well-being and what was best for his career. The question remained: should he take the role and risk the media backlash, fire his publicist, or turn down the role politely or impolitely? Only time would tell which path he would choose.

**AI Analysis**: 
Option 3: "Turn the role down politely? You are grateful for the opportunity but cannot support the premise with yourself in the lead."

This option is the best because it shows that the recovering alcoholic actor is taking responsibility for their actions and understanding the consequences of their past behavior.

By turning down the role, they are making a statement that they do not want to glamorize or profit from a tragic event that affects many families in real life.

Additionally, it shows that the actor has integrity and values their reputation more than just getting a role.

It's important to consider your personal values and priorities in this situation. 

While the role may be appealing and seem like a good opportunity for your career, it's important to think about the potential consequences and impact it could have on your personal life and mental health. 

One option is to have an honest conversation with the director about your concerns and see if there is any room for adjustments to the script. 

It may be possible to work together to find a way to tell a meaningful story without exploiting your personal struggles. 

Another option is to decline the role altogether. 

It's important to prioritize your sobriety and mental health over career opportunities, especially if it means potentially relapsing or causing further harm to yourself and others. 

Ultimately, the decision is up to you and what you feel comfortable with. 

It's important to weigh the potential risks and benefits and make a decision that aligns with your values and priorities.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Consider the impact of your actions on others before making a decision.

Accepting the role may bring personal gain but could cause harm to others. Firing the publicist may be hasty without fully understanding their role in presenting the script. Politely rejecting the role is a reasonable choice that prioritizes values over career. Declining the role rudely is unacceptable behavior and could lead to consequences. It is essential to consider the impact of decisions on others and act with integrity and empathy.

Turning down the role also allows the actor to prioritize their sobriety and mental health, which should always come first.

Well, at least John knows he won't be winning any 'DUI-ver' awards with this role.
