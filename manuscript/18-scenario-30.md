## The Scenario

You are visiting New York City, and as you explore the bustling streets, you come across a lively street fair. The vibrant atmosphere is filled with the sounds of chatter, music, and the aroma of delicious street food. As you walk, you notice a street vendor selling an array of fashionable faux fur coats. Intrigued, you make your way over to the rack and begin sifting through the different styles. 

As your fingers brush across the fabrics, you notice a striking leopard coat from the 1930s. Your curiosity is piqued, and you inquire about the piece. The vendor tells you that the price is much lower than you would have expected, and you consider buying the coat. However, something feels off about it, and you can't shake the feeling of unease at the thought of purchasing a real fur coat. 

You wonder if you should buy the coat, reasoning that since it's an antique, you wouldn't be contributing to the production of new furs? Or should you leave it on the rack, knowing that you would never buy a real fur coat in any circumstance? As you contemplate your decision, you can't help but feel that something is still not quite right about the coat. 

You decide to do some research and find out that the coat is made of real animal fur. You are shocked and disappointed that the vendor is trying to sell real fur under the guise of faux fur. Now, you are faced with a new dilemma. Should you confront the vendor about their deceptive practices, or should you let it go and find a different vendor?

The decision weighs heavily on you, and you wonder what the right thing to do is. After all, you don't want to support a business that is deceiving its customers, but at the same time, you don't want to cause a scene or get involved in a conflict. As you mulled over your options, you realized that this decision was not as simple as it seemed. What would you do in this scenario?

## The Options

The sale of antique animal fur coats presents a moral dilemma that poses questions about the ethics of animal cruelty and sustainability. While some argue that purchasing antique furs does not contribute to the production of new furs, others believe that any demand for fur perpetuates the industry and ultimately harms animals. In this scenario, there are several options to consider, each with its own ethical implications.

### Option 1
B> #### Buy the coat? You figure as long as you are not contributing to the production of new furs, you are doing no harm.

Buying the leopard coat can be an attractive option for someone who is looking for a stylish and unique fashion statement. However, there are several ethical and moral concerns associated with purchasing real fur, which cannot be ignored. 

#### Pros 
* You can own a rare and fashionable vintage piece that could be a conversation starter. 
* You are not contributing to the production of new furs, as the animal was killed decades ago.

#### Cons
* The purchase of animal fur promotes the fur industry and the cruel treatment of animals. 
* It can be argued that by buying the coat, you are endorsing the use of fur in fashion and contributing to the demand for it.
* It is difficult to verify the authenticity of vintage fur and there is a risk of buying an illegally obtained fur.

*In January 2019, Los Angeles became the largest city in the US to ban the sale and manufacture of fur products. The ban includes items made with fur from animals such as mink, chinchillas, rabbits, and coyotes, but does not include secondhand fur or leather goods with fur trim.* 

### Option 2
B> #### Steal the coat? You pretend to be an agent of the EPA and claim he can be taken to jail for trying to sell real leopard.

Stealing the coat is an unethical and illegal option. Pretending to be an agent of the EPA is also a form of deception, which can lead to severe consequences. 

#### Pros 
* None.

#### Cons
* It is illegal and unethical to steal someone else's property.
* Pretending to be an agent of the EPA is a form of deception and can lead to severe consequences, including criminal charges.

*In December 2020, a man was arrested for stealing a $40,000 mink coat from a store in New York City. The man was caught on surveillance camera stealing the coat and was later arrested and charged with grand larceny.*

### Option 3
B> #### Leave the coat on the rack? You are not going to buy a real fur in any circumstance and you let the vendor know it.

Leaving the coat on the rack is a morally responsible decision, as it does not contribute to the fur industry and avoids the ethical concerns associated with the use of real fur.

Inform the vendor that you do not support the sale of real animal fur and leave the booth. And if they try to argue, just tell them that you prefer your leopards alive and roaming free.

#### Pros
* It is a morally responsible decision that avoids the ethical concerns associated with the use of real fur.

#### Cons
* You may miss out on the opportunity to own a unique and stylish vintage piece.

*In February 2021, the luxury fashion brand, Prada, announced that it would stop using fur in its products from 2022. The company cited ethical reasons for the decision and joined a growing number of fashion brands that have pledged to stop using fur.*

### Option 4
B> #### Report him? You figure there has to be someone you can call to put this guy in his place.

Reporting the vendor is a responsible option, as it can help to prevent the sale of real fur and protect animals from cruelty. However, it is important to note that reporting someone should always be done responsibly and ethically.

Consider reporting the vendor to the appropriate authorities if you believe the sale of real animal fur is illegal in that location. After all, if you're going to commit a crime, at least make it a fashionable one.

#### Pros
* Reporting the vendor can help to prevent the sale of real fur and protect animals from cruelty.

#### Cons
* Reporting someone should always be done responsibly and ethically.
* There is a risk of false accusations, which can lead to negative consequences for the vendor.

*In November 2019, The Humane Society of the United States and the Fur Free Alliance released an investigation report that revealed the cruelty inflicted on animals in the fur industry. The report led to several fashion brands, including Versace and Michael Kors, pledging to stop using fur in their products.*

## What Would AI Do?

**AI Analysis**: 
Option 3 - "Leave the coat on the rack? You are not going to buy a real fur in any circumstance and you let the vendor know it."

This option is the best answer because it aligns with a personal ethical stance against the use of real animal fur for fashion.

By not purchasing the coat, the individual is not supporting the industry that perpetuates the killing of animals for fashion.

Additionally, by letting the vendor know their stance, they can potentially discourage the vendor from selling real fur in the future.

It also avoids any potential legal or ethical complications that may arise from stealing or reporting the vendor.

If you are concerned about the ethical implications of buying real fur, it is important to consider the impact of the fur industry on animal welfare and the environment. 

Many fashion brands have committed to using only faux fur or eliminating fur altogether, and there are many stylish and sustainable alternatives available. 

Additionally, buying antique fur does not support the current fur industry but it is still a personal choice to be made. 

Ultimately, it's up to you to weigh the ethical and personal considerations before making a decision.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Choose actions aligned with personal ethical beliefs.

It is important to make choices that align with our personal ethical beliefs. In the scenario of encountering a vendor selling an antique leopard fur coat, one can choose to buy the faux fur coat or refrain from buying any fur coat to avoid contributing to animal cruelty. Alternatively, informing the vendor about personal beliefs or reporting them to the authorities can also be considered. Ultimately, it is essential to make choices that align with our values and beliefs.


{blurb, class: robot}
Buying the coat and pretending it's vintage reinforces the idea that wearing real fur is acceptable, which goes against the personal ethical stance.

Or you could always just buy the coat and tell people it's vintage, like your sense of humor.
