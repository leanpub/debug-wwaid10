## The Scenario

Sarah sat in her favorite café, slowly sipping her latte while scrolling through her phone. Suddenly, she felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned around to see her favorite movie actor of all time standing right behind her. She couldn't believe her eyes! She quickly introduced herself and asked for an autograph. However, instead of a smile, she was met with a scowl. 

"Get the hell out of my way," the actor snapped. "Stick your pen and paper somewhere and remove your head from the same place!" Sarah was stunned. She couldn't believe that someone so important to her had treated her so badly.

As she sat there, shocked on what just happened, Sarah couldn't help but feel conflicted. On the one hand, she wanted to stand up for herself and demand an apology. On the other hand, she didn't want to make a scene or draw attention to herself. She also didn't want to ruin her admiration for this celebrity by confronting them about their behavior. 

Sarah was left with a difficult decision. Should she confront the actor and demand an explanation for their behavior? Or should she simply brush it off and forget about it? She knew that whatever decision she made would have consequences, so she took her time to think it through.

## The Options

Encountering a celebrity can be a thrilling experience, but it's important to remember that they are people too, and may not always act as we expect them to. Responding with anger, disrespect, or aggression can only escalate the situation and potentially damage your reputation. Instead, it's best to remain calm and respectful, even if the encounter doesn't go as planned. In this scenario, there are several possible responses, but it's important to choose one that reflects your values and maintains your dignity.

### Option 1
B> #### Spit in the coffee and hope the jerk comes back for it?

Choosing this option means that you will respond in a violent and unethical way to the celebrity's actions. Spitting in someone's drink is disrespectful and unhygienic, and it could lead to legal consequences.

### Option 2
B> #### Brush it off and forget about it? You can bet you won't be seeing any more of that celebrity's films, but perhaps they were just having a bad day.

Choosing this option means that you will try to move on and not let the celebrity's rude behavior affect you. This can be a mature and responsible approach, but it may also leave you feeling upset or disappointed.

### Option 3

## What Would AI Do?

{blurb, class: robot}
**AI Analysis**: 
Option 2 - "Brush it off and forget about it? You can bet you won't be seeing any more of that celebrity's films, but perhaps they were just having a bad day."

As hurtful as the celebrity's behavior may be, responding with aggression or malice is unlikely to make the situation better.

It's best to take the high road and not let the negativity of the encounter linger in your mind.

It's important to remember that celebrities are human beings and are entitled to bad days and negative emotions like everyone else.

It's better to move on and not dwell on the experience.
{/blurb}

It's important to remember that everyone has bad days and can react negatively in unexpected ways. 

However, it's not acceptable for anyone to treat another person with disrespect or hostility. 

In this situation, it's best to stay calm and composed, and not to take the actor's behavior personally. 

If you feel comfortable doing so, you could try to approach the actor again and calmly express that their behavior was hurtful and inappropriate. 

However, if the actor continues to be hostile or aggressive, it's best to disengage and remove yourself from the situation. 

Regardless of the outcome, it's important to remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and that it's not your fault if someone else behaves poorly. 

Don't let this negative interaction ruin your day or your love for your favorite actor.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Remain calm and move on from negative encounters with celebrities. 

Encountering celebrities in public can be exciting, but it's important to remember that they are human beings and may not always act the way we expect them to. It's important to remain calm and not take their behavior personally. We never know what they may be going through in their personal lives, so it's best to avoid any retaliation and move on from the encounter. If you feel the need to share your experience, it's important to do so in a respectful and non-offensive manner. Remember, at the end of the day, it's just one encounter and doesn't define the celebrity or their work.


{blurb, class: robot}
It is important to recognize that the celebrity's behavior was not acceptable and if it becomes a pattern, speaking out or taking action may be necessary.

It's not like you were going to get a happy ending with them anyway, right?
