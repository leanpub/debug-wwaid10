It's natural to feel envious when someone we helped succeed surpasses us. In this scenario, a friend has moved up the ranks while the person who helped them is still in the same position. The question now is, what should they do to cope with their feelings and continue their own career growth? 

How do we balance our desire for our friends' success with our own career aspirations when the two seem to be in conflict?

## The Scenario

John had been your good friend for years, and when you landed a job at your firm, you decided to help him out too. You put in a good word for him with the hiring manager, and before long, he was working beside you in the mail room. You were happy to have him there, and it wasn't long before you noticed that John was excelling at the job. He was always the first to arrive and the last to leave, and he always had a smile on his face.

As time went on, John continued to impress everyone with his hard work and dedication. He was promoted to supervisor, and then again to assistant manager. It was no surprise to you or anyone else when he was promoted yet again, this time to become chief assistant to the board - a prestigious position in charge of grooming the next generation of corporate leaders.

Meanwhile, you were still in the mail room, but you had been promoted to shift supervisor. You were happy for John's success, but you couldn't help but feel a little envious when you heard that he was negotiating a raise. After all, you had also been promoted, but you hadn't seen a salary bump since then. 

You started to wonder how John had managed to climb the corporate ladder so quickly. He began coming in earlier and staying later, and he started schmoozing with the higher-ups. You didn't realize it at the time, but John was determined to move up the ladder and was willing to do whatever it took to get there.

But then something changed. John was no longer content with just being a manager. He wanted to move even higher up the corporate ladder, and he started to become more competitive and ambitious. You couldn't help but feel a little put off by his sudden change in behavior, especially when you were still stuck in the mail room.

It was at this point that you realized that you had a decision to make. You could try to get John fired or ask him for a little nudge, demand that he get you a raise, or decide to leach off his success. The choice was yours, but you knew that every choice had consequences. And as you struggled with your decision, you couldn't help but wonder how everything had come to this point.

## The Options

It's not uncommon to feel envious or bitter when a friend achieves success before you. However, it's essential to recognize that their accomplishments don't diminish your value, and it's crucial to avoid acting on those negative emotions. Instead, use the situation as an opportunity to reflect on your career goals and take proactive steps towards achieving them. In this scenario, we'll explore four different responses to a friend's success and discuss their potential outcomes. These options include seeking revenge, asking for a favor, demanding immediate help, or leveraging the friend's success to advance your own career.

### Option 1
B> #### Find a way to get him fired? You are starting to get bitter at this point and would rather get revenge than help.

The first option, seeking revenge by attempting to get the friend fired, carries the satisfaction of vengeance but at the cost of ethical compromises and potential damage to both professional and personal relationships. Historical examples, such as the lawsuit against Tesla, highlight the consequences of unethical actions in the workplace.

{blurb, class: robot}
Well, at least I helped my friend climb the corporate ladder. Too bad I'm still stuck on the bottom rung.
{/blurb}

#### Pros
* You can have your revenge on your friend
* You can take the job that you think you deserve

#### Cons
* You may need to do something unethical to get him fired
* You may lose a friend and a possible reference for future job applications

*In 2016, a former employee of Tesla filed a lawsuit against the company for firing him after he raised concerns about the safety of the Model S battery. He claimed that he was retaliated against for being a whistleblower. In this case, the employee tried to do the right thing by raising safety concerns, but he was fired instead. It is important for companies to have a whistleblowing policy in place to protect employees who come forward with concerns about unethical behavior.*

### Option 2
B> #### Ask for him to give you a little nudge? You just need a little boardroom namedrop every week or so.

Option two involves asking the successful friend for a favor, hoping for a bit of influence to secure a raise. While this approach maintains the friendship, it risks portraying the individual as needy or desperate, with potential limited outcomes, as seen in the Starbucks diversity training incident.

{blurb, class: robot}
I guess I could ask my friend for a raise too, but I doubt they'll be willing to share their success secrets.
{/blurb}

#### Pros
* You may be able to get some recognition from the higher-ups
* You can maintain your friendship with your colleague

#### Cons
* You may come across as needy or desperate
* Your colleague may not be able to help you as much as you hope

*In 2018, the CEO of Starbucks faced backlash for an incident in which two black men were arrested for sitting in a Starbucks store without making a purchase. The incident sparked protests and calls for a boycott of the company. In response, Starbucks implemented diversity training for all employees and changed its policy to allow anyone to use its stores, regardless of whether they make a purchase. In this case, the company's response to the incident shows that it is possible to make changes when problems are brought to the attention of higher-ups.*

### Option 3
B> #### Pull the got him the job card and ask him to make something happen? You need more than a namedrop: you demand he get you a raise, pronto.

The third option, demanding immediate help based on the favor of securing the friend's job, introduces a sense of entitlement and may strain the relationship. Drawing parallels to the Amazon workers' protest, it emphasizes the importance of ethical behavior when addressing workplace concerns.

{blurb, class: robot}
I'll ask my supervisor for feedback, but I have a feeling they'll tell me to 'just be more like my friend.'
{/blurb}

#### Pros
* You may be able to get the raise you deserve
* You can remind your colleague of the favor you did for him

#### Cons
* You may come across as entitled or ungrateful
* Your colleague may not be able to help you, or may not want to

*In 2020, Amazon faced criticism for its treatment of warehouse workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Workers protested and called for better working conditions and hazard pay. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos initially dismissed the concerns, but eventually announced that the company would provide hazard pay and other benefits to workers. In this case, the pressure from workers and the public forced the company to take action to address unethical behavior.*

### Option 4
B> #### Leach off his success? You decide to hang around him more and make your own opportunities to schmooze with the higher-ups.

Option four, leaching off the friend's success by making personal opportunities to connect with higher-ups, is regarded as the most proactive and ethical choice. It allows for career advancement without resorting to manipulation or harming the friend's success. The cautionary tale of the college admissions scandal serves as a reminder of the repercussions of unethical attempts to leverage personal connections for advancement.

{blurb, class: robot}
Who knows, maybe I'll be the CEO one day. Or at least I'll have a good story for when I'm in therapy.
{/blurb}

#### Pros
* You may be able to make some valuable connections
* You can learn from your colleague's success and use it to your advantage

#### Cons
* You may come across as insincere or manipulative
* Your colleague may not appreciate your attempts to ride his coattails

*In 2019, a controversy arose when it was revealed that wealthy parents had paid bribes to get their children into prestigious universities. The scandal led to the arrest and prosecution of several parents and university officials. In this case, the parents were trying to use their wealth and connections to get their children ahead, but their unethical behavior ultimately backfired.*

## What Would AI Do?

{blurb, class: robot}
**AI Analysis**: 
Option 4: …leach off his success? You decide to hang around him more and make your own opportunities to schmooze with the higher-ups.

This option is better than the others because it allows you to take a proactive approach to advancing your career without resorting to manipulation or sabotaging your friend's success. 

Finding a way to get your friend fired is malicious and unethical. It's important to remember that your friend's success isn't the cause of your stagnation, and seeking revenge will only create more problems in the long run.

Asking for a little nudge might seem harmless, but it could put your friend in an uncomfortable position and potentially strain your relationship. Relying on someone else to advance your career can also make you feel powerless and dependent.

Pulling the "got him the job" card and demanding a raise can come across as entitled and unprofessional. It's important to approach career advancement based on your merits and hard work, rather than leveraging personal connections in an aggressive manner.
{/blurb}

It's understandable to feel frustrated in this situation, but it's important to approach it in a professional and productive manner. 

Here are some steps to take: 

1. Reflect on your own performance and contributions to the company. Are there areas where you could improve or take on additional responsibilities? Have you made your accomplishments and goals clear to your supervisor? 
2. Schedule a meeting with your supervisor to discuss your career goals and ask for feedback on your performance. Use this opportunity to inquire about potential opportunities for advancement or additional compensation. 
3. Avoid comparing yourself to your friend or others in the company. Every employee's career path is unique, and focusing on others' success can be counterproductive. 
4. Consider seeking out additional training or education to improve your skills and make yourself a more valuable asset to the company. 
5. Finally, if you feel that you are not being compensated fairly, it may be worth exploring other job opportunities. 

However, it's important to make this decision carefully and ensure that you are not making a hasty decision based solely on emotions.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Jealousy can be harmful and unproductive in the workplace.

Jealousy is a natural emotion, but it can be detrimental to your career and relationships. It's important to focus on your own growth and development rather than comparing yourself to others. Seek feedback from your supervisor, learn from successful colleagues, and network to find new opportunities. Avoid doing anything that could harm your friend's career, and consider having an open and honest conversation with them about your feelings. Remember that success is not a zero-sum game, and there is room for everyone to succeed.


{blurb, class: robot}
Becoming a successful corporate leader takes hard work and dedication, and by taking a proactive approach to building your network, you're setting yourself up for long-term success.

And who knows, maybe someday you'll be the one in charge of grooming the next generation of corporate leaders – or at least the one making the big bucks. As they say, "Behind every successful person is a substantial amount of coffee."
