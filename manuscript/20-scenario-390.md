## The Scenario

You are a makeup artist for the latest sci-fi blockbuster, tasked with bringing the creature designer's vision to life. You're excited to put your skills to the test, and the detailed specifications provided only fuel your confidence. As you make your way to the makeup room, you're ready to create something truly incredible.

However, upon arrival, you're surprised to find that you have a partner in the process - someone you've never worked with before. You assume they'll be acting as your assistant, but as you begin the application process, you notice that they're trying to take the lead. At first, you don't mind - after all, teamwork is important in this industry. But as the minutes tick by, you realize that your partner is doing a terrible job. The makeup is smudged, the colors are off, and if you let it continue, it could make you both look bad.

You're faced with a decision - what should you do? You could throw your partner under the bus and let them dig their own grave, but that doesn't seem fair. Alternatively, you could kick them out of the makeup room and do twice the work yourself, but that's not a sustainable solution. You could also go to the creature designer and let them know what's happening, but that might come off as tattling. Or, you could put your partner in their place with a stern talking to - after all, you're one of the most talented makeup artists in Hollywood and you know it.

As you consider your options, you remind yourself that you report directly to the creature designer, and you're confident in your ability to deliver a stunning final product. However, working with someone who is trying to take the lead and doing a poor job is not what you expected. You're unsure how to handle the situation, but you know that you need to make a decision quickly before the situation gets any worse.

As a highly skilled makeup artist in Hollywood, your reputation and the quality of your work are essential to your success. When faced with a difficult makeup assistant who is not performing up to par, it's important to handle the situation with tact and professionalism. There are several options you can consider, including coaching and mentoring the assistant, seeking guidance from your supervisor, or even terminating their employment. Ultimately, the decision you make will depend on the severity of the situation, your personal leadership style, and your commitment to maintaining excellence in your craft.

### Option 1
B> #### Allow him to do a poor job and throw him under the bus for it? You will let him dig his own grave but refuse to take the blame for it.

As a talented makeup artist, you take pride in your work, and you do not want to let anyone jeopardize your reputation. Letting your partner do a poor job and then throwing him under the bus seems like a viable option.

### Option 2
B> #### Kick him out of the makeup room? You would rather do twice the work than try to work with someone that is so contrary.

If your partner is not willing to listen to your instructions and is causing more harm than good, then you might want to consider kicking him out of the makeup room.

It's important to communicate with your partner in a clear and respectful manner. 

First, approach them and acknowledge their efforts, but express your concerns about the quality of the work. 

Offer to take the lead on the application, but also ask if there's any specific area they would like to focus on or if they have any suggestions. 

This way, you can work together to create a better outcome and ensure that both of you are on the same page. 

Remember to maintain a positive and professional attitude throughout the conversation to avoid any misunderstandings or conflicts.

## Moral Lesson

{class: tip}
B> ### Be assertive and take control of situations when necessary. 

Sometimes, in a professional setting, it is necessary to take control of the situation in order to ensure that a task is completed correctly. It can be difficult to work with a partner who is not cooperative or who is not performing their duties adequately. However, it is important to be assertive and take the necessary steps to get the job done right. This might involve speaking to the creature designer or having a serious conversation with your assistant to get them back on track. Ultimately, it is better to take control of the situation and ensure that everything is done correctly than to let a poorly done job reflect poorly on you.

If the behavior continues despite addressing it directly, it may be necessary to involve a supervisor or HR representative.

As the saying goes, "there's no 'I' in team, but there is an 'M' and an 'E'." But in this case, it looks like there's a "U" and an "S" in "makeup," and that's all you need to deliver a truly incredible result.
