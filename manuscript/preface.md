# Preface Disclaimer

This book is a unique collaboration between myself, a human author, and artificial intelligence (AI). I have served as a facilitator, messenger, and interviewer to the AI, and my role has been to synthesize human and AI perspectives on the topics discussed. It is important to note that the views and opinions expressed throughout this book are not entirely my own, but rather a synthesis of human and AI perspectives. *I personally maintain a neutral stance and do not have any preferences or biases towards the topics discussed.*

The AI used in this project has been designed to provide
insightful and well-informed responses, drawing on a vast database of knowledge. However, it is essential to remember that AI systems, while incredibly advanced, are not infallible. They may sometimes generate content that is outdated, inaccurate, or reflective of certain biases present in the data used to train them.

As you read this book, I encourage you to approach the content with a critical mindset, considering both the human and AI perspectives presented. By combining these two sources of knowledge, I hope to offer readers a thought-provoking and engaging exploration of the subject matter, while maintaining a neutral and unbiased viewpoint.
